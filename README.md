# Smart Cities Project

This project focuses on the analysis of various datasets related to smart cities. The goal is to utilize data analytics to derive insights and contribute towards the development of smarter urban areas.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories and Jupyter notebooks, each serving a specific purpose in the data analysis process.

### Directories

- **raw**: Contains raw datasets used for analysis.
- **filtered**: Contains filtered datasets after initial processing.
- **temperature-maps**: Includes visualizations related to temperature data.
- **path-maps**: Contains visualizations related to path analysis.
- **maps**: Other miscellaneous maps generated during analysis.

### Jupyter Notebooks

- **db1-analysis.ipynb**: Data analysis and insights from Database 1.
- **db2-analysis.ipynb**: Data analysis and insights from Database 2.
- **db3-analysis.ipynb**: Data analysis and insights from Database 3.
- **db4-analysis.ipynb**: Data analysis and insights from Database 4.
- **unified-analysis.ipynb**: Combined analysis incorporating data from all databases.

## Overview

### Data Sources

The raw data used in this project is stored in the `raw` directory. Each dataset corresponds to a different aspect of smart cities, such as traffic patterns, temperature data, etc.

### Analysis Overview

- **Database 1**: Focuses on analyzing traffic patterns and identifying peak congestion times.
- **Database 2**: Involves the study of environmental data, particularly temperature variations.
- **Database 3**: Examines public transportation usage and efficiency.
- **Database 4**: Investigates energy consumption patterns in urban areas.
- **Unified Analysis**: Integrates insights from all databases to provide a comprehensive view of smart city dynamics.

### Visualizations

The `maps`, `temperature-maps`, and `path-maps` directories contain various visualizations generated during the analysis, helping to illustrate the insights derived from the data.
